      <h1>Sample App</h1>
      <p>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

        This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests. You'll create your own Hello World repository and learn GitHub's pull request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.
        
        In this quickstart guide, you will:
        
        Create and use a repository
        Start and manage a new branch
        Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits
        Open and merge a pull request
        To complete this tutorial, you need a GitHub account and Internet access. You don't need to know how to code, use the command line, or install Git (the version control software that GitHub is built on). If you have a question about any of the expressions used in this guide, head on over to the glossary to find out more about our terminology.</p>
